What is a leap year? (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE)
##################################################################

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.


Note:
    - to solve this, you would need to use "Modulus" ("%")
