# You're planning a meal and want to see which ingredients two recipes have in common.
# Write a function that takes two lists of ingredients and returns a set of common ingredients.


def common_ingredients(recipe1, recipe2):
    # Your code here
    pass


# Test the function
pancakes = {"flour", "sugar", "eggs", "milk", "butter"}
choco_cake = {"sugar", "eggs", "chocolate", "butter"}
print(common_ingredients(pancakes, choco_cake)) # should print {"sugar", "eggs", "butter"}
